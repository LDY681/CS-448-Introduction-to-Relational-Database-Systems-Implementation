Complexity Requirements:
In my HeapFile class, I have a pageIdList, which is a list of all pageIds of pages in the heap file.
To meet the complexity requirements stated in part2,
I implemented pageIdList as a sorted ArrayList.
The sorting method is in SortByFreeSpace class, which sorts pageIdList by the freeSpace from ascending order.
So when I insert a record, I would just retrieve the last pageId in the list (The one with most free space).
If the last page doesn't have enough free space, then I would create another page and insert there.
This ensures O(1) for insertRecord.
Since deleteRecord and updateRecord take rid as the parameter and simply calls corresponding method in HFPage,
their complexity is also O(1).
